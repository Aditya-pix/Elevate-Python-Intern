# 🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot (Task 8)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a simple **rule-based chatbot** built using Python.  
It uses **if-elif-else conditions** to respond to user inputs and runs in a loop until the user types `"bye"`.  

This project demonstrates the **basics of chatbot logic  structure**.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.7+  
(No external libraries are needed.)

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this project or copy the `chatbot.py` file.  
2. Run the chatbot:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Example Conversation
```
🤖 Chatbot: Hi! I'm your simple chatbot. Type 'bye' to exit.
You: hello
🤖 Chatbot: Hello there! How can I help you?
You: what’s your name?
🤖 Chatbot: My name is PyBot 🤖
You: bye
🤖 Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a nice day 👋
```

---

## 📜 Code Structure
- **Loop with `while True`** → keeps the chatbot running.  
- **`input()`** → takes user input.  
- **`if-elif-else`** → matches keywords like `"hello"`, `"how are you"`, `"name"`, `"weather"`.  
- **Default response** → if no keywords match.  
- **Exit condition** → typing `"bye"` ends the chatbot.

## 🎯 Outcome
✅ Understand how rule-based chatbots work  
✅ Learn how to use conditions in Python  
✅ Foundation for more advanced NLP chatbots
